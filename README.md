# Responsive-Portfolio

This assignment uses the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a personalized, mobile responsive portfolio.  I have created three files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.  They each have a navbar, a responsive layout, and responsive images.  I have also included an assets folder with images found within the portfolio.  This portfolio utilizes Bootstrap's Grid System.

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Consistent Navbar on each page.

* The pages contain personalized information. (bio, name, images, etc.)

* It properly utilizes Bootstrap components and its grid system.
